Once the ticket is clicked on. You will be able to see all the details inside (status, priority, department, etc). 
In the example the reporting party is informing that their employee's are unable to access the online banking portal. There is a chance that this event can affect a wide variety of people and have critical impact on the business and will most likely need to be directed to another department to be worked on. In the ticket received by the help desk agent they will be able to add updates, re-route and respond to the customer until the issue is resolved.

In the example provided, the comment section of the ticket shows the worklog. The agent is able to comment and provide any steps whether internally or externally to the reporting party to show the steps taken to resolve the issue.

After the issue has been resolved, you will have the option to resolve the issue and or update the status to whatever is necesary. In this example the agent scrolls up from the comment section they were working on and clicks on status > resolve. It will give you the option to put a comment on the resolution or just to close it out. As this is all for documentation purposes.
